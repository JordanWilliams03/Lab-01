    <p style="color:lavender">
        Jordan, born and raised in Canada, was and still is a simple life. Slow, but in the slow of steadily watching
        <br>the fields of flowers as they brush and move from the wind, blowing on them.
        <br>Full of peace, his life was tranquil.

        It all begain in the year 1984, where the queen of england (rest in peace her soul) beat me in a mega sized
        <br>chess match. That's when i found her cloning lab... Wait, this is an autobiography of Jordan, not a scrapped
        <br>Rick and Morty episode.

        In all seriousness, Jordan loves to play games. In fact, to help support his gaming needs, he went and got a job. In fact, he got hired ON THE SPOT at Tim Horton's.
